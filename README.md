LinkTransformer is a Python library for merging and deduplicating data frames using language model embeddings. It leverages popular Sentence Transformer (or any HuggingFace) models to generate embeddings for text data and provides functions to perform efficient 1:1, 1:m, and m:1 merges based on the similarity of embeddings. Additionally, the package includes utilities for clustering and data preprocessing. It also includes modifications to Sentence Transformers that allow for logging training runs on weights and biases.

More tutorials are coming soon!

## News

- If you like this resource and want to help build it further, we would appreciate contributions. Currently, we wish to make the API compatible with the latest sentence-transformers updates. 
- A bug on package import on Google Colab is now fixed. 
- If you are just looking to demo the package on your data, try out this [HuggingFace Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/96abhishekarora/linktransformer_merge) to merge two data frames!!
- New (and retrained) models are up on the organisation's (dell-research-harvard) huggingface (with the same paths). Be sure to check them out. Most get a bump in the training data size, better hyperparams (and loss function choices). Training data for each  model is also included within the repo. 
- Online contrastive loss is now available for linkage model training - especially useful for training with paired data containing binary labels. Try it out! The tutorial will be out soon.

## Features

- Merge dataframes using language model embeddings
- Deduplicate data based on similarity threshold
- Efficient 1:1, 1:m, and m:1 merges
- Clustering methods for grouping similar data
- Support for various NLP models available on HuggingFace
- Classification - prediction, and training in one line of code!

## Coming soon
- FAISS GPU, cuDF, cuML and cuGraph integration
- Integration of other modalities in this framework (Vision/Multimodal models)
- Hard negative mining for efficient training


## Installation

```bash
pip install linktransformer
```

## Getting Started

```python

import linktransformer as lt
# Example usage of lm_merge_df
merged_df = lt.merge(df1, df2, merge_type='1:1', on='key_column', model='your-pretrained-model-from-huggingface')

# Example usage of dedup
deduplicated_df = lt.dedup_rows(df, model='your-pretrained-model', on='text_column', threshold=0.8)
```

All transformer based models from [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/) are supported. We recommend [sentence-transformers](https://www.sbert.net/docs/pretrained_models.html) for these tasks as they are trained for semantic similarity tasks. 

## Usage 

### Merging Pandas Dataframes

The merge function is used to merge two dataframes using language model embeddings. It supports three types of merges: 1:1, 1:m, and m:1. The function takes the following parameters:

![Linkktransformers demo_example](https://github.com/dell-research-harvard/linktransformer/assets/60428420/9f9fb9b8-a82b-4f2f-a111-4ee99baa0818)


```python
def merge(df1, df2, merge_type='1:1', on=None, model='your-pretrained-model', left_on=None, right_on=None, suffixes=('_x', '_y'),
                 use_gpu=False, batch_size=128, pooling_type='mean', openai_key=None):
    """
    Merge two dataframes using language model embeddings.

    :param df1 (DataFrame): First dataframe (left).
    :param df2 (DataFrame): Second dataframe (right).
    :param merge_type (str): Type of merge to perform (1:m or m:1 or 1:1).
    :param model (str): Language model to use.
    :param on (Union[str, List[str]], optional): Column(s) to join on in df1. Defaults to None.
    :param left_on (Union[str, List[str]], optional): Column(s) to join on in df1. Defaults to None.
    :param right_on (Union[str, List[str]], optional): Column(s) to join on in df2. Defaults to None.
    :param suffixes (Tuple[str, str]): Suffixes to use for overlapping columns. Defaults to ('_x', '_y').
    :param use_gpu (bool): Whether to use GPU. Not supported yet. Defaults to False.
    :param batch_size (int): Batch size for inferencing embeddings. Defaults to 128.
    :param openai_key (str, optional): OpenAI API key for InferKit API. Defaults to None.
    :return: DataFrame: The merged dataframe.
    """


```

A special case of merging is aggregation (use function: aggregate_rows)- when the left key is a list of items that need aggregation to the right keys. Semantic linking is also allowed with multiple columns as keys in both datasets. For larger datasets, merge_blocking can be used to merge within blocking keys. 


### Clustering or Deduplicating Data

![Linkktransformers demo_dedup](https://github.com/dell-research-harvard/linktransformer/assets/60428420/91c71fd3-dfe4-4918-bf4e-61f9189a35ff)


```python
def dedup_rows(df, model='your-pretrained-model', on='text_column', cluster_type='preferred_cluster_type', cluster_params= {'threshold': 0.8}, openai_key=None):
    """
    Deduplicate a dataframe based on a similarity threshold. This is just clustering and keeping the first row in each cluster.
    Refer to the docs for the cluster_rows function for more details.

    :param df (DataFrame): Dataframe to deduplicate.
    :param model (str): Language model to use.
    :param on (Union[str, List[str]]): Column(s) to deduplicate on.
    :param cluster_type (str): Clustering method to use. Defaults to "SLINK".
    :param cluster_params (Dict[str, Any]): Parameters for clustering method. Defaults to {'threshold': 0.5, "min cluster size": 2, "metric": "cosine"}.
    :param openai_key (str): OpenAI API key
    :return: DataFrame: The deduplicated dataframe.
    """

def cluster_rows(df, model='your-pretrained-model', on='text_column', cluster_type='preferred_cluster_type', cluster_params= {'threshold': 0.8}, openai_key=None):
    """
    Deduplicate a dataframe based on a similarity threshold. Various clustering options are supported.         
    "agglomerative": {
            "threshold": 0.5,
            "clustering linkage": "ward",  # You can choose a default linkage method
            "metric": "euclidean",  # You can choose a default metric
        },
        "HDBScan": {
            "min cluster size": 5,
            "min samples": 1,
        },

            "min cluster size": 2,
            "threshold": 0.1,
        },
    }

    :param df (DataFrame): Dataframe to deduplicate.
    :param model (str): Language model to use.
    :param on (Union[str, List[str]]): Column(s) to deduplicate on.

    :param openai_key (str): OpenAI API key
    :return: DataFrame: The deduplicated dataframe.
    """

```

We allow a simple clustering function to cluster rows based on a key. Deduplication is just keeping only one row per cluster.


### Get similarity score between 2 sets of columns

```python

def evaluate_pairs(df,model,left_on,right_on,openai_key=None):
    """
    This function evaluates paired columns in a dataframe and gives a match score (cosine similarity). 
    Typically, this can be though of as a way to evaluate already merged in dataframes.

    :param df (DataFrame): Dataframe to evaluate.
    :param model (str): Language model to use.
    :param left_on (Union[str, List[str]]): Column(s) to evaluate on in df.
    :param right_on (Union[str, List[str]]): Reference column(s) to evaluate on in df.
    :return: DataFrame: The evaluated dataframe.
    """
