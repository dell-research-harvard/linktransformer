Detroit area

Workers in 21
factories idle
 DETROIT. (4). The huge war
production program in the De-
troit area was impaired Wednes-
day as maintenance workers in
more than a score of factories
began a strike which their
/union officers said earlier would
‘be deferred pending a meeting
with the war labor board.
Before noon 8,000 maintenance
employes had left their jobs, 11
plants had been closed down, and
more than 50,000 workers had
been sent home. Maintenance
workers in ten other factories
had left their jobs and addi-
tional closings affecting another
50,000 or more workers were
said by company spokesman as
probable.

construction and powerhouse
workers council of the United
Automobile Workers (C. I, O.)

The council represent 38,000
maintenance men in more than
300 plants in the Detroit area, in-

strike by all the maintenance
workers would directly and in-
directly affect several hundred
thousand workers in the Detroit
area and paralyze the war pro-
duction effort.

Closed Wednesday forenoon
were seven plants of the Briggs
Manufacturing company, where
1,100 were on strike and 30,000
workers had been sent home;
the Wyoming plant of the De
Soto division of Chrysler cor-
poration; the Chrysler East
Jefferscn avenue plant and two
